# YOLO V3


YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection system that uses deep learning techniques to detect objects in images and videos. YOLO V3 is the third iteration of the YOLO series and was released in 2018.

YOLO V3 uses a feature extractor based on a deep neural network architecture called Darknet-53, which has 53 convolutional layers. This architecture helps to capture rich features of an image, allowing YOLO V3 to detect objects with high accuracy.

YOLO V3 also uses a technique called multi-scale prediction to detect objects of different sizes. It divides the input image into a grid of cells and makes predictions for each cell at three different scales. This allows YOLO V3 to detect small objects that might be missed by other object detection systems.

Another important feature of YOLO V3 is its ability to detect objects in real-time, making it well-suited for applications like video surveillance, self-driving cars, and robotics.

To use YOLO V3 for object detection, you need to first train the system on a dataset of labeled images. Once the system is trained, it can be used to detect objects in new images or videos.

## Results
The script will save each frame with the bounding boxes and labels drawn onto them in a new folder called frames. The video will also be displayed in a window with the detected objects and their respective confidence scores.
